# ISLR_lab_using_Python

ISLR is a book written to explain key topics in statistical learning in a less technical way. The intention of ISLR is to concentrate more on the applications of the methods with each chapter contains a lab illustrating how to implement the statistical learning methods.

This repository stores all the lab sessions and exercises for ISLR book rewritten with Python instead of R. 

The contents include: 

## Chapter 3: Linear Regression 

Summary of the chapter: 

Linear regression is a useful tool for predicting a quantitative response and a widely used statiscal learning approaches. It is a very straightforward approach for predicting a quantitative response Y on the basis of predictor variables X. It assumes that there is an approximately linear relationship between X and Y.
