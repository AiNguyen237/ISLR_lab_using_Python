# ISLR_lab_using_Python

ISLR is a book written to explain key topics in statistical learning in a less technical way. The intention of ISLR is to concentrate more on the applications of the methods with each chapter contains a lab illustrating how to implement the statistical learning methods.

This repository stores all the lab sessions and exercises for ISLR book rewritten with Python instead of R. 

The contents include: 

## Chapter 3: Linear Regression 

Summary of the chapter: 

Linear regression is a useful tool for predicting a quantitative response and a widely used statiscal learning approaches. It is a very straightforward approach for predicting a quantitative response Y on the basis of predictor variables X. It assumes that there is an approximately linear relationship between X and Y.

### Chapter 4: Classification Models

Summary of the chapter:

The response for Linear Regression is assumed to be quantitative, while in many situations the response variable is qualitative. This is where classification models come into play. There are many possible classification techniques (classifiers) that can be used to predict a qualitative response. The classifiers introduced in the chapter are: linear discriminant analysis, quadratic discriminant analysis, Naive Bayes, and Logistic Regression. In addition, generalized linear models such as Poisson regression were also introduced.
